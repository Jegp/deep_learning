A small deep learning library written in [Futhark](https://futhark-lang.org)
as part of my bachelor thesis.

The library currently supports multilayer perceptron and convolutional networks

A formal documentation is WIP, but see [programs](https://github.com/HnimNart/futhark_ann_func/tree/master/programs)
for examples on how to build a network using the library

If you find bugs, or find something that can be improved
please open an issue! thanks!


## Installation

```
$ futhark-pkg add github.com/HnimNart/deeplearning
$ futhark-pkg sync
```


## Usage

See example program for now.
